<a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1375666/">IMDb Inception  (2010)</a>
	<p style="font-family: Helvetica"> Inception is my favorite movie out of the three listed above. I really enjoyed the musical score that was written and conducted by Hans Zimmer. I also appreciate <strong>orginal</strong> movies! This movie really made me think, requires dead silence and is definitely a thriller.</p>
	<p style="font-family: Helvetica"> The Dark Knight and The Fast and Furious saga are runner up to Inception. The Dark Knight was also scored by Hans Zimmer. The theme of the movie is very dark and gothic. It's a more grown up version of a vigilante cinema. I enjoy the Fast and Furious saga because I have always loved racing. I've grown up with these movies and I feel a sense of connection to all the characters. I even felt extremely bad for the late Paul Walker! But these movies have always been close to my heart, even the "not-so-good" movies which I won't list.</p>
